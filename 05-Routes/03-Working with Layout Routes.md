## Introducing Layout Routes

In more complex React apps with routing, it's common to have shared layout elements across different pages. For instance, a navigation bar or header that remains consistent throughout the app. To implement this, layout routes are used in React Router. Layout routes allow you to define common elements, such as a header, and "nest" other routes within them, ensuring the layout is shared across different pages.

**Key Concepts**

**Layout Route:** A route that wraps other routes and defines common layout elements like headers, sidebars, or footers.
**Children Routes:** Nested routes that inherit the layout and are rendered inside the layout route's content.
**Outlet Component:** A placeholder component provided by React Router where the content of the nested routes is injected.

### Steps to Create a Layout Route

1. **Create the Layout Component:** In this case, we create a RootLayout component that includes the shared MainHeader and an Outlet where the nested route content will appear.
2. **Update the Route Configuration:** Modify the route configuration to include the RootLayout component as a layout route, and nest the other routes inside it using the children key.
3. **Refactor Code:** Ensure the MainHeader is only in the layout route, so you don't end up with duplicate headers in your app.

**Code Explanation**

**RootLayout.jsx:** This component contains the layout that will be shared across multiple routes (in this case, the MainHeader). The Outlet component serves as a placeholder where the nested route components (like App or NewPost) will be rendered.

```javascript
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import MainHeader from '../components/MainHeader';

function RootLayout() {
    return (
        <>
            <MainHeader />
            <Outlet />  {/* Placeholder for nested routes */}
        </>
    );
}

export default RootLayout;
```

**main.jsx:** Here, we configure the router to use RootLayout as the layout route and nest the individual routes ('/' and '/create-post') inside it. This ensures that both routes share the same layout.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'
import NewPost from './components/NewPost'
import RootLayout from './routes/RootLayout'

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/', element: <RootLayout />,  // Layout route with MainHeader
    children: [
      { path: '/', element: <App /> },            // Home route
      { path: '/create-post', element: <NewPost /> }  // New post route
    ],
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

**Key Changes**

**RootLayout:** This is a layout route that wraps the MainHeader and places the route-specific content via the Outlet component.
**Nested Routes:** Inside the children array, the home page ('/') and the new post page ('/create-post') are nested under the layout route. This ensures the layout is shared while rendering different components based on the URL.
**Refactoring:** The MainHeader is now placed only in RootLayout, so it's not duplicated in the App component, ensuring the header appears only once across the app.

**Behavior**
- When you visit the home path ('/'), the RootLayout component renders the MainHeader, and the App component is loaded inside the Outlet.
- When you navigate to the new post path ('/create-post'), the RootLayout still renders the MainHeader, but the NewPost component is loaded inside the Outlet.

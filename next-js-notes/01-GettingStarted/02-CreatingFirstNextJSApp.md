## Creating a First Next.JS App

To create a Next.js app, you'll need a few key pieces of software and tools. 

### Required Software

**1. Node.js and npm**
    **Node.js:** Next.js is built on top of Node.js, so you need to have it installed on your system. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side.
    **npm (Node Package Manager):** These are package managers that help you manage the dependencies for your Next.js application. npm comes bundled with Node.js, but you can also use Yarn if you prefer.

    You can install Node.js (which includes npm) from the official Node.js website. Yarn can be installed separately from Yarn's website.

**2. Text Editor or IDE**

While you can technically use any text editor, some are particularly well-suited for JavaScript and React development. Popular choices include:
    o	Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A widely used code editor that offers great support for JavaScript, React, and Next.js through extensions. It also includes features like integrated terminal, Git integration, and debugging tools.
    o	WebStorm: A powerful IDE by JetBrains with excellent support for JavaScript and frameworks like React and Next.js.
    o	Sublime Text or Atom: Both are lightweight editors that can be configured with plugins for React development.

**3. Git (optional, but recommended)**

**Git:** Version control system for tracking changes in your codebase. Git is highly recommended for managing and collaborating on projects. You can download Git from the official Git website.

**4. Terminal or Command Line Interface**

You'll use the terminal to run commands related to Node.js, npm, and Next.js. On macOS and Linux, you can use the built-in Terminal. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or the more advanced Windows Terminal.

**5. Browser**

**Web Browser:** You'll need a web browser to view and test your application. Modern browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge are recommended.

### Setting Up a Next.js Project

Once you have these tools installed, setting up a new Next.js project is straightforward. 

**Here are the typical steps:**
1.	Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2.	Run the following command in the folder you want to create a new Next.js app using create-next-app:
3.	Then you will be asked a series of questions:
    a.	What is your project named? (first-app)
    b.	Would you like to use Typescript? (No) 
    c.	Would you like to use ESLint? (Yes)
    d.	Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? (No)
    e.	Would you like to use `src/` directory? (No)
    f.	Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) (Yes)
    g.	Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? (No)

Then your app will start to be created.

4.	Navigate to your project directory:
5.	Start your project by running:

**NOTE:** Your project will now be accessible from http://localhost:3000.

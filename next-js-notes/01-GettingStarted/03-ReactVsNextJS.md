## React vs. Next.js

**1.	Content in Page Source:**
**Standard React App:**
    o	When you view the page source in your browser, you’ll mostly see an empty page with some script tags. The actual content visible on the screen is not included in the HTML sent from the server.
    o	This is because React operates entirely on the client side. It sends a barebones HTML page with a minimal setup, and then JavaScript runs in the browser to dynamically generate and manipulate the content.
**Next.js App:**
    o	When you view the page source in your browser, you’ll see the actual page content directly in the HTML. This is because Next.js renders the page on the server before sending it to the client.
    o	This means the content is included in the HTML that comes from the server, so it's visible even if you inspect the page source.
**2.	Rendering Approach:**
**Standard React App:**
    o	React operates primarily on the client side. It means that the page is initially loaded with minimal HTML, and then React dynamically builds and updates the page content using JavaScript in the browser.
    o	This approach allows for dynamic updates and interactive features without needing to reload the page from the server.
**Next.js App:**
    o	Next.js supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). This means that Next.js can generate the HTML content on the server before sending it to the client.
    o	This approach combines client-side and server-side rendering, providing the benefits of faster initial page loads and better SEO (since search engines can see the content directly).
**3.	Client-Side vs. Full-Stack:**
**Standard React App:**
    o	It's mainly a client-side application. It runs entirely in the browser, and any data fetching or other backend interactions need to be handled separately (e.g., through API calls).
    Next.js App:
    o	It’s a full-stack framework. This means it can handle both client-side and server-side code within the same project. You can use Next.js to render pages on the server and also build API routes for backend functionality.

In summary, Next.js provides additional features over standard React, particularly in terms of rendering and SEO, by combining server-side and client-side capabilities. This allows Next.js to serve fully rendered HTML content from the server, which can improve performance and SEO, whereas standard React relies on client-side JavaScript to build the content dynamically in the browser.

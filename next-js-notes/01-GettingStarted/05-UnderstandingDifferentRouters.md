## Understanding the Different Routers in Next.js

**1. The Two Router Options: Pages Router vs. App Router**

In Next.js, there are two ways to build your application, known as Pages Router and App Router. These approaches are used for routing – determining how different pages in your app are accessed via URLs.

**•	Pages Router:** The older, more stable way of routing, which has been around for years. It's well-suited for projects that follow the traditional Next.js setup.

**•	App Router:** A newer approach introduced in Next.js 13. It offers modern features but may still have some bugs since it's relatively new.

**2. Core Concept: Server-Side Rendering**

Regardless of which router you choose, both methods allow you to create full-stack applications in Next.js, where the pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client.

### The Pages Router
**1. Overview:**

The Pages Router uses a file-based routing system. It’s an established, reliable way to build feature-rich full-stack apps using Next.js and React.

**Example:**
    •	You create a file about.js in the pages directory.
    •	Next.js automatically sets up the route so that when you visit yourwebsite.com/about, it renders the about.js page.

**2. Key Features:**
    •	File-Based Routing: Organize your pages into folders and files, and Next.js handles the routes for you.
    •	Stability: The Pages Router has been around for years and is widely used in many production-level projects.
**Example:**

If you have an index.js file in the pages folder, it represents the homepage (/). Similarly, creating more files like contact.js or services.js will correspond to the URLs /contact and /services.

### The App Router

**1. Overview:**

The App Router is the newer approach, introduced with Next.js 13. It brings more modern features to the table, such as React Server Components and Server Actions.

**Example:**

When you use the App Router, you can have parts of your app render on the server (for efficiency), while others render in the browser (for interactivity).

**2. Key Features:**
    •	Modern Features: Unlocks advanced capabilities like Server Components, which can help improve performance by running part of your app on the server.
    •	Future of Next.js: Even though it’s new and might have some issues, this approach represents the direction Next.js is heading in future versions.

**Example:**

A React Server Component allows parts of your app (such as fetching data from an API) to happen on the server. This makes the app faster since the browser doesn’t have to wait for data to load.

### Making a Decision: Pages Router or App Router?

**1.	Which One to Use:**
    •	If you’re working on an existing project or need a stable setup, use the Pages Router.
    •	If you want to explore new features and work with modern capabilities, go with the App Router.

**2.	Learning Both:**

In this guide (or course), you'll learn about both the Pages Router and the App Router, allowing you to work on any Next.js project, no matter which method is used.

Summary
**•	Pages Router:** An older, stable way to build full-stack apps using file-based routing.
**•	App Router:** The newer method with modern features like React Server Components and Server Actions.
**•	Server-Side Rendering:** Both routers support server-rendered pages, ensuring faster load times and better SEO.
**•	Flexibility:** Learning both routers equips you to handle any Next.js project.

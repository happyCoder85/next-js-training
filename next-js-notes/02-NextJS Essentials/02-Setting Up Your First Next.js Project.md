## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project
### Summary:

This section guides you through creating and setting up a new Next.js project. It provides options for working locally or using an online environment like CodeSandbox.

### Local Development:

**1. Project Creation:**
    The recommended approach is to create a project locally using the command npx create-next-app my-app-name. Replace my-app-name with your desired project name.

**2. Project Structure:**
    The instructor provides a pre-made project structure you can download (not included here). This structure can be used as a starting point for your project.

**3. Code Editor:**
    The guide recommends using Visual Studio Code, but any code editor suitable for JavaScript development will work.

**4. Project Customization:**
    The instructor has made minor modifications to the default project (logo, styles, etc.). You can customize your project as needed.

**5. Installing Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run npm install to install all required dependencies.

**6. Starting Development Server:**
    Run npm run dev to start the development server. This allows you to preview your application in a web browser.

### Previewing the Application:

Once you've set up your development environment, you can preview your application by visiting the provided address in your web browser. This will display the default Next.js starting page.

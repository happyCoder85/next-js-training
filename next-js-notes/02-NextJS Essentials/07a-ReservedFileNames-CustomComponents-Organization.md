## Organizing Your Next.js Project: Layouts, Components, and Global Styles

**Summary:**

This section explores additional aspects of Next.js project structure, including global styles, components, and the role of specific file names.

### Global Styles:

**globals.css:** Use this file to define styles that apply to your entire application.
**Importing:** Import the globals.css file into your layout.js to make the styles available globally.

### Custom Components:

**Creating Components:** Create separate .js files for your components. These files can be located anywhere in your project, but the app directory is often used for routing-related files.
**Naming:** While component names are not reserved, using lowercase names for consistency is recommended.
**Importing and Using Components:** Import components into your pages or layouts and use them as needed.

### Special File Names:

**page.js:** Defines the content of a page.
**layout.js:** Defines the layout for a group of pages.
**icon.png:** Used as the favicon for your application.

**Key Points:**

- The app directory is primarily used for routing and page structure.
- You can create custom components and store them in separate files.
- Global styles can be defined in a globals.css file and imported into your layout.
- Special file names like page.js, layout.js, and icon.png have specific purposes in Next.js.

**Additional Notes:**

- Consider using a linter or formatter to maintain consistent code style.
- Explore different project structuring approaches to find what works best for you.
- Refer to the official Next.js documentation for more in-depth information on project structure and conventions.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively organize and structure your Next.js projects, leading to better code maintainability and scalability.

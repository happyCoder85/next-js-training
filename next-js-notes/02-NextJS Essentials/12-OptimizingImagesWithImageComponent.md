## Optimizing Images with Next.js Image Component

In Next.js, images can be optimized using the built-in Image component, which provides several benefits over the traditional HTML <img> tag. Here's how to integrate and use the Next.js Image component in the MainHeader component for better performance and user experience.

### Key Features of the Next.js Image Component:

**Lazy Loading:** Automatically lazy loads images, meaning they only load when they are visible on the page.
**Responsive Images:** Dynamically serves images in different sizes based on the viewport and device, ensuring optimized loading.
**Efficient Image Formats:** Automatically serves images in the best format for the user's browser, such as WebP in browsers that support it (e.g., Chrome).
**Priority Loading:** You can specify certain images to be loaded with higher priority, like a logo that is always visible when the page loads.

### Replacing the <img> Tag with Next.js Image Component

In the original MainHeader component, the logo was displayed using a regular HTML <img> tag. However, switching to the Next.js Image component makes it more efficient. The Image component is imported from next/image and is designed to handle several optimizations automatically.

### Steps to Use the Image Component

**1. Import the Image Component:**

Instead of using the standard <img> tag, import the Image component from Next.js.

```js
import Image from 'next/image';
```

**2. Set src to the Imported Image Object:**

When using the Image component, the src prop should refer to the image object imported from your assets folder, not just the src property of the object like you would with an <img> tag.

```js
src={logoImg}
```

**3. Add the priority Prop:**

Since the logo is an important element that will always be visible when the page loads, itâ€™s a good practice to add the priority prop. This tells Next.js to load the image as soon as possible, avoiding delays and content shifts on page load.

```js
priority
```

### Other Optimizations:

By default, the Image component automatically lazy loads images and determines the best file format based on the user's browser (e.g., serving WebP images for browsers that support it).

If needed, you can control image width and height explicitly, though Next.js can infer it from the imported image object.

#### Updated Code Example:
```js
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';
import logoImg from '@/assets/logo.png';
import classes from './main-header.module.css';

export default function MainHeader() {
    return (
        <header className={classes.header}>
            <Link className={classes.logo} href="/">
                <Image 
                    src={logoImg} 
                    alt="A plate with food on it"
                    priority
                />
                NextLevel Food
            </Link>

            <nav className={classes.nav}>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <Link href="/meals">Browse Meals</Link>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Link href="/community">Foodies Community</Link>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
    );
}
```

### Key Optimizations Implemented:
- **Lazy Loading:** The Image component automatically lazy loads images, unless they are marked with priority. This ensures that images below the fold are only loaded when needed.
- **Responsive Images:** The component creates a srcset automatically, serving the correct size based on the device and viewport, improving load times.
- **Optimized Formats:** Next.js automatically serves images in the most efficient format, like WebP, which reduces the image file size without compromising quality.

**Conclusion:**

Using the Next.js Image component for your images ensures optimized performance out of the box, with features like lazy loading, responsive sizing, and efficient file formats. Adding the priority prop to important images like the logo ensures they load as quickly as possible for a smooth user experience.

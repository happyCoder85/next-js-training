## Module Overview

In this module, we'll be building a demo application for a fictional food lover community. This app will allow users to browse meals and share meals with other community members. As we build this project, you’ll learn the essential NextJS concepts needed to work on any NextJS application, regardless of its complexity.

### Key NextJS Concepts We'll Cover

**1. Routing and Setting Up Pages**

We’ll begin by learning how to create and navigate between pages in NextJS. You’ll see how each file in the pages folder automatically maps to a route, simplifying the setup process. For example, creating a pages/index.js file automatically becomes the homepage route (/).

**Example:** We'll set up routes for viewing all meals and sharing new meals.

**2. Working with Components**

NextJS integrates React seamlessly, allowing you to build reusable UI components. You’ll learn how to structure your app using components that can be reused across pages.

**Example:** Components for displaying meal details, meal lists, and forms for adding meals.

**3. Full Stack Application Simplification**

NextJS makes it easier to build full stack applications by handling data fetching and server-side rendering. You’ll see how to fetch data from APIs and how to submit forms, processing data on the backend while keeping your front-end code clean.

**Example:** Implementing backend logic for creating and retrieving meals using API routes.

**4. Data Fetching & Server-side Rendering**

We’ll dive into data fetching methods like getServerSideProps and getStaticProps, which allow you to fetch data either on the server side or during the build process.

**Example:** Fetching meals from a database and rendering them on the homepage.

**5. Styling Your NextJS Application**

Learn how to style your application using built-in support for CSS, CSS Modules, and styled-jsx. We’ll explore techniques to create clean, responsive designs.

**Example:** Styling the meal list with custom CSS Modules for unique class names.

**6. Working with Images Efficiently**

NextJS offers optimized image handling through the next/image component. You’ll learn how to manage images efficiently, which is key for performance and SEO.

**Example:** Displaying images of meals with automatic optimization for different screen sizes.

**7. Uploading Images**

You'll also discover how to upload images to the server, a crucial part of creating user-driven content. We’ll explore both the front-end and back-end processes of handling image uploads.

**Example:** Allowing users to upload images of their meals along with their submissions.

**8. Setting Up Page Metadata**

SEO is an important part of any web application. We’ll cover how to set page metadata (like titles, descriptions, and meta tags) to ensure your application ranks well in search engines.

**Example:** Adding metadata to each page, such as a custom title for individual meal pages.

This module is packed with essential NextJS skills. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of routing, data handling, image management, and much more, all while building a functional and engaging application. Let’s dive in and start mastering these NextJS essentials!

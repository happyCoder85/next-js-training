## Introducing State in React

As we dive deeper into React, it's time to explore one of its most powerful and essential concepts: state. After getting familiar with components and props, state management becomes the next crucial step. But what exactly is state, and how does it work?

Imagine you're building a component that allows users to add new posts. This component, instead of just rendering a static list of posts, should dynamically respond to user input. For example, as you type a new post or author name into a form, that information should appear in the list of posts immediately. This is where state comes into play.

### Adding the Form for a New Post
To set the stage, we'll create a new component to display the form. This form will allow users to input the post content and author name. The component renders basic HTML elements like a textarea for the post body and an input field for the author name. Here's how we set that up:

The form is built using a new NewPost component, and to integrate it properly, you'll import the corresponding NewPost.jsx and NewPost.module.css files.

```jsx
import classes from './NewPost.module.css';

function NewPost() {
  return (
    <form className={classes.form}>
      <p>
        <label htmlFor="body">Text</label>
        <textarea id="body" required rows={3} />
      </p>
      <p>
        <label htmlFor="name">Your name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" required />
      </p>
    </form>
  );
}

export default NewPost;
```

This form component, just like any other component, renders simple HTML markup but using JSX syntax. You might notice the htmlFor attribute on labels and className for styling. These are slight deviations in JSX from standard HTML attributes to avoid clashes with JavaScript keywords.

Displaying the Form in the App
Next, the form should be rendered alongside the existing list of posts. However, since React requires each component to have only one root element, you’ll need to use a fragment (<>...</>) to wrap the form and the post list.

This approach allows the NewPost form to coexist with the PostList component in the App component, without violating React's rules about multiple sibling root elements.

Here’s how you would add the NewPost component above the post list:

```
import React from 'react';
import PostList from './components/PostList';
import NewPost from './components/NewPost'; // Import the form component

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <NewPost /> {/* Add the form above the list */}
      <PostList />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Preparing for State Changes
Now that the form is in place, the next step is to allow the user’s input to affect the displayed posts. Currently, typing into the form doesn’t do anything, but the ultimate goal is for the text entered in the form to dynamically update the posts. This is where React’s state feature shines.

State will enable real-time interaction. As you type into the form, the state will capture the input and update the posts below.

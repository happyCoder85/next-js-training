## State and Conditional Content

To enhance our modal, we’ll add functionality to close it, such as clicking on the backdrop. We'll handle this with state, event listeners, and conditional rendering. Here's how:

**1. Track Modal Visibility with State:**

We need to control whether the modal is shown or hidden using a piece of state that manages its visibility. This can be done with the useState hook in React.

In the component where the modal is used (e.g., PostsList), we initialize the modal's visibility with a state variable, modalIsVisible, which starts as true (the modal is visible by default).

```jsx
const [modalIsVisible, setModalIsVisible] = useState(true);
```

Now, we want to update this state when the backdrop is clicked. This means we’ll add an event listener to the backdrop to trigger the state change, hiding the modal.

**2. Set Up a Function to Hide the Modal:**

We create a function, hideModalHandler, that sets modalIsVisible to false. This function will be triggered when the backdrop is clicked.

```jsx
const hideModalHandler = () => {
  setModalIsVisible(false);
};
```

**3. Pass the Handler to the Modal:**

We pass hideModalHandler as a prop to the Modal component so it knows how to handle clicks on the backdrop.

```jsx
<Modal onClose={hideModalHandler}>
  <NewPost />
</Modal>
```

In the Modal component, we use the onClose prop to trigger the click event on the backdrop:

```jsx
const Modal = ({ onClose, children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="backdrop" onClick={onClose}></div>
      <dialog className="modal" open>
        {children}
      </dialog>
    </>
  );
};
```

**4. Conditionally Rendering the Modal:**
Now we need to ensure that the modal is only rendered when modalIsVisible is true. Here are three ways to handle this:

  **Option 1: Ternary Operator**
  We can use a ternary operator to conditionally render the modal:

  ```jsx
  {modalIsVisible ? <Modal onClose={hideModalHandler}><NewPost /></Modal> : null}
  ```

  This code checks if modalIsVisible is true. If so, it renders the modal. If not, it renders null, meaning nothing will be shown.

  **Option 2: Logical AND Operator**

  Another option is using the logical AND (&&) operator. This works by rendering the modal only if modalIsVisible is true:

  ```jsx
  {modalIsVisible && <Modal onClose={hideModalHandler}><NewPost /></Modal>}
  ```

Here, the modal is rendered only when modalIsVisible is truthy. If it's false, nothing is rendered (since false && anything results in false).

  **Option 3: Storing JSX in a Variable**

  Alternatively, you can store the JSX for the modal in a variable and conditionally assign it based on the state:

  ```jsx
  let modalContent = null;
  if (modalIsVisible) {
    modalContent = <Modal onClose={hideModalHandler}><NewPost /></Modal>;
  }
  ```

  Later in the JSX, you can output modalContent:

  ```jsx
  {modalContent}
  ```

  This approach allows for more flexibility, as you can prepare the modal content in a variable and render it elsewhere in your component.

**Recap:**
  - State tracks the modal’s visibility.
  - Event listeners handle user interactions (e.g., clicking the backdrop).
  - Conditional rendering ensures the modal is only displayed when necessary. You can choose from the ternary operator, logical AND, or storing JSX in a variable based on your preferences.

All three methods are valid and will ensure that the modal is properly shown or hidden based on user interaction.

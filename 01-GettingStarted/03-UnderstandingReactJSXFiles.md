## Guide to Understanding React JSX Files

```
1. Main Entry File: main.jsx
    •	Purpose: This is the main file where everything starts when the website loads. It is the first code executed, which sets up and
        renders the React app in the browser.
    •	What Happens:
        o	Imports necessary features from the React and React DOM libraries.
        o	Uses ReactDOM.createRoot() to target an element with the ID root in the index.html file. This is where the React app will be
            rendered.
        o	Calls the render() method, passing JSX code (React’s special syntax) to be displayed inside this root element.
        o	Example: If your index.html has a <div id="root"></div>, React uses main.jsx to fill this element with content.
2. Dependencies with package.json
    •	Purpose: The package.json file manages the project’s dependencies (third-party libraries). In this case, it includes React and
        React DOM.
    •	What Happens: When you install React, both libraries are installed:
        o	React handles component logic.
        o	React DOM allows React components to interact with the HTML DOM.
    •	Example: You don't need to manually download files; just list them in package.json and let Node.js handle installation.
3. Rendering React Components
    •	ReactDOM.createRoot() and render(): These functions start the process of rendering React components inside the browser.
        o	createRoot() selects the element with the ID root.
        o	render() places the React content inside that element.
    •	Example: If you pass JSX code like <App /> to render(), React will render this App component inside the <div id="root"> element.
4. Strict Mode
    •	Purpose: React's StrictMode is used to help developers by enabling additional checks and warnings for potential issues.
    •	What Happens: It doesn’t affect the functionality of your app but provides alerts for deprecated code or suboptimal practices.
    •	Example: It helps catch errors during development that might cause problems in future versions of React.
5. React Components: App.jsx
    •	What is a Component?
        o	Components in React are functions that return JSX code, which gets converted to HTML by the browser.
        o	App.jsx is an example of a component. It returns a simple H1 element with the text "Hello World."
    •	Example: A React component like App is used like an HTML element: <App />. This is how JSX makes it easy to embed reusable
        components in your code.
6. Component Structure
    •	How Components Work:
        o	A component like App is a building block of a React application.
        o	It returns JSX code and React takes care of rendering it on the page.
    •	Example: When the App component returns <h1>Hello World</h1>, React renders that HTML on the screen.
7. Building Complex User Interfaces with Components
    •	Purpose: React is all about breaking down user interfaces into smaller, reusable components.
    •	What Happens: You can build complex websites by creating components for things like a header, sidebar, or footer, and combining
        them to make the entire app.
    •	Example: If you wanted to add a navigation bar and a footer, you could create NavBar.jsx and Footer.jsx components and include
        them in your main app file.
8. Next Steps: Creating Custom Components
    •	Purpose: Components allow you to create a modular structure for your web application.
    •	What's Next: You’ll learn how to create more custom components beyond just the simple App component, to further develop your app's
        structure and functionality.
```
By understanding how these key elements like main.jsx, JSX, and components work together, you can start building and organizing React applications effectively.

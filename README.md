## Exploring NextJS and React
### -- The Ultimate Roadmap to Mastery --

This is a guide created for NextJS and React based off the course ![Next.js 14 & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/?couponCode=OF83024F) by ![Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/#instructor-1). He is a fantastic instructor, and makes things simple and clear. I have also incorporated ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to provide different examples where I was unsure after watching the videos. I recommend following along with the examples, and trying different things to really solidify your understanding. Each section is marked 1, 2, 3, etc. This is the recommended order to go through.

I hope this guide will help others working to learn NextJS and wish everyone much success. Lets begin!

### What is NextJS?
Next.js is a popular open-source framework built on top of React.js. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easier to build modern web applications with React. Here’s a brief overview of what it is and why you might use it:

**Definition**
Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build server rendered React applications with ease. It supports features like:

    •	Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pages can be rendered on the server before being sent to the client, improving initial load performance and SEO.

    •	Static Site Generation (SSG): Pages can be pre-rendered at build time, allowing for fast load times and better performance.

    •	Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Allows updating static content incrementally without rebuilding the whole site.

    •	API Routes: Enables you to create backend API routes within the same codebase, simplifying development by keeping front-end and 
    back-end code together.

    •	Built-in CSS and Sass Support: Provides support for importing CSS and Sass files directly.

    •	File-Based Routing: Pages are automatically routed based on the file structure in the pages directory.

**Why Use It?**
    1.	Performance Optimization: Next.js optimizes performance with server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting. This helps improve load times and overall user experience.

    2.	SEO Benefits: Server-side rendering and static generation make it easier to optimize pages for search engines since content is rendered and available to crawlers when the page loads.

    3.	Developer Experience: Next.js offers a great development experience with features like hot reloading, built-in CSS support, and a well-structured project setup.

    4.	Flexibility: You can choose between server-side rendering, static site generation, or even a hybrid approach for different pages within the same application, depending on your needs.

    5.	API Routes: It simplifies full-stack development by allowing you to build API endpoints within the same project, reducing the need for a separate backend server.

    6.	Community and Ecosystem: Next.js has a strong community and a rich ecosystem of plugins and integrations, making it easier to extend and customize your application.

In summary, Next.js is used to build performant, scalable web applications with React, offering various rendering options and developer conveniences to streamline the development process.
